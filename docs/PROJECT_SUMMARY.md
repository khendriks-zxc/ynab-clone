# üß† Project Summary: Self-Hosted Budget Tracker

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to build a modular, self-hosted personal finance tracker inspired by YNAB (You Need A Budget). It will allow manual import of bank transactions, apply zero-based budgeting logic, and generate customizable dashboards‚Äîinitially in Excel, with optional migration to a browser-based UI.

The system is designed for autonomy, flexibility, and extensibility, with a focus on local-first architecture and personal control over data and logic.

## 2. Objectives

### Strategic Objectives
- Eliminate reliance on YNAB subscription and US-based integrations
- Enable tailored budgeting views and logic for South African and Dubai banking contexts
- Create a frictionless, enjoyable learning path for Python and system design

### Technical Objectives
- Build a Python‚ÄìExcel hybrid MVP for transaction import, categorization, and budget tracking
- Implement version control and modular architecture for future upgrades
- Design assistant prompt files for AI agent handoff and role-based support

## 3. Key Outcomes
- ‚úÖ MVP Python script to clean and categorize bank CSVs
- ‚úÖ Excel dashboard with budget summaries and visualizations
- ‚úÖ GitHub-hosted repo with structured folders and README
- üß™ Optional Streamlit/Flask dashboard for browser-based access
- üß† Assistant prompt file for agent setup and role definition

## 4. Scope & Constraints
- Manual bank file uploads only (no API integrations)
- Local execution preferred; cloud hosting optional
- Excel remains primary dashboard format until browser UI is ready
- Modular design to support future agent roles and logic extensions
